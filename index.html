		<p>Hi, my name is Gaurav Koley and I am a all-time-hungry-for-code geek. I love technology. I believe in standards. I believe in doing things the right way.</p>
		
		<p>I like to think I am a good blogger,developer,creative writer, musician and a not so good designer. I still delude myself into believing we should strive for some semblance of privacy on the web.</p>
		<p>I love to learn, about anything. I am obviously starved for content.</p>
