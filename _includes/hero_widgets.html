    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a all-time-hungry-for-code geek. I love technology. I believe in standards. I believe in doing things the right way.

I like to think I am a good blogger,developer,creative writer, musician and a not so good designer. I still delude myself into believing we should strive for some semblance of privacy on the web.

I love to learn, about anything. I am obviously starved for content.
