# Sani

Less Code. More Blogging.

Sani is a blogging framework designed by Gaurav Koley for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you need to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Sani, all you need to do is  clone or fork Sani, install dependencies, and you’re set.

# What is Sani?

Sani is Jekyll blogging at its finest.

    Sani sports a clean responsive theme written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.
    Code blogging is easy and beautiful. Embed code (with Solarized styling) in your posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.
    Third party integration is simple with built-in support for Twitter, Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and Google Analytics.
    It's easy to use. A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
    Ships with great plug-ins some original and others from the Jekyll community — tested and improved.

Contributing

We love to see people contributing to Sani, whether it's a bug report, feature suggestion or a pull request. At the moment, we try to keep the core slick and lean, focusing on basic blogging needs, so some of your suggestions might not find their way into Sani. For those ideas, we started a list of 3rd party plug-ins, where you can link your own Sani plug-in repositories. For the future, we're thinking about ways to easier add them them into our main releases.
