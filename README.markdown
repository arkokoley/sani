# Sani - Less Code. More Blogging.

Sani is a blogging framework designed for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages, to be used on Github Pages with Prose.io.

Sani is a bunch of HTML, CSS and Javascript files along with a Rakefile. The HTML, CSS and JS form the theme while rake gives you automation regarding generating and publishing the blog. 

Sani uses Disqus for comments and a basic, extendable, responsive theme based on [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) . 

#Why? 

To start blogging with Jekyll, you need to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Sani, all you need to do is clone or fork Sani, install Jekyll (only dependency), and you’re set. All else is taken care of.(This is when you are setting up from your own computer.)

Setting up Sani is so easy, it can be done even if you don't have access to the device you regularly use.

#Installation

1. Fork Sani.
2. Rename the forked repo to 'username.github.com', where username is your username.
3. Log in to Prose.io. It works with Github, don't worry.
4. Navigate to the newly forked repo and edit the _config.yml.
5. Navigate to _posts/ in that repo, create a new file and start writing.

Viola! Only 5 steps and about 5 minutes to setup a blog from zero.
